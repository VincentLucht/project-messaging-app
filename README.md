## üìö What I learned
### The importance of planning
- Insufficient planning lead to backtracking and adding new features - thoroughly planning and laying everything out in the beginning would have made everything easier

### Creating a large-full stack project from scratch
- Gained deep understanding of creating a full-stack project from scratch
- Learned how to use a technology that was alien to me (socket.io) to create something fully functional
- Got the hang of fully deploying a project
